      <description>Class: Class time is designed to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so as much as possible you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each class.
Grading: Your final grade will be comprised of the following:</description>

      <description>GitHub     R/RStudio    GitHub is a web-based version control repository and Internet hosting service. We will be using GitHub in this course as a collaboration platform and a course management system (i.e. submit homework in GitHub as opposed to on Sakai). In order to get started, create a GitHub account, but before then, read about picking a good username. All course materials, including private repositories for students, are on the GitHub organization.</description>
